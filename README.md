# CreateStrongPasswords
CSP is an improved solution to the sign-up process on a website to help users achieve strong and hard-to-crack passwords.  
    
What is wrong with passwords?  
In today's digital world, accessing websites and services requires user accounts and passwords for authentication.   
Users often choose weak passwords, share them with others, or reuse them across multiple platforms, making their accounts vulnerable to security breaches.   
Studies have shown that most breaches happen due to users' selection of short and simplistic passwords.   
While users bear responsibility, websites also contribute to the problem by allowing weak passwords to be created.   
Ultimately, companies suffer the consequences of security breaches, experiencing financial losses and reputational damage.  
    
How should a contemporary registration page look like?  
The suggested approach to improving the sign-up process involves a website that provides valuable information on password security.   
The prototype features a user-friendly registration process with helpful messages and feedback to guide users, including checking the chosen password against blacklists and dictionaries. If the password is strong, brief feedback is given, but if it is weak, longer feedback is provided with specific advice, encouraging users to consider starting the process again.  
The password policy implemented on the website is strict, with users having to choose from four different categories when creating their passwords: upper and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols. It was mostly chosen because websites do not adhere to best practices and let users pick weak passwords.  
    
Even though the password policy implemented on the website was somehow stricter, the users put little effort into creating their passwords, making the prototype easy to use and providing satisfactory information for them to generate strong passwords.  
The features of the prototype were helpful for participants, with the strength meter and the feedback post-password attempt getting positive reactions overall.   
The generated passwords obtained high scores; for that reason, the prototype could be considered a real success.  
  
Websites should have more strict policies, information on potential risks, password feedback, and a live strength meter to help users create strong passwords, therefore offering them better account protection.  
It is crucial for users to prioritize password creation as it is their primary defence against unauthorized access and potential negative outcomes such as identity theft, financial loss, or reputation damage.
