# CreateStrongPasswords
CSP is an improved solution to the sign-up process on a website to help users achieve strong and hard-to-crack passwords.  
# What is wrong with the passwords?  
In today's digital world, accessing websites and services requires user accounts and passwords for authentication.   
Users often choose weak passwords, share them with others, or reuse them across multiple platforms, making their accounts vulnerable to security breaches.   
Studies have shown that most breaches happen due to users' selection of short and simplistic passwords.   
While users bear responsibility, websites also contribute to the problem by allowing weak passwords to be created.   
Ultimately, companies suffer the consequences of security breaches, experiencing financial losses and reputational damage.
