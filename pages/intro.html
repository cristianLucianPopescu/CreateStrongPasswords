                            <p> <b>A long password is a good password</b> <br><br>
                                When it comes to password security, length really 
                                does matter. We recommend opting for a password that’s at least 12 characters long,
                                even longer if you can. Each additional symbol in a password exponentially increases 
                                the number of possible combinations. This makes passwords over a certain length 
                                essentially uncrackable, assuming you’re not using common phrases. 
                            </p>

                            <p> <b>Password strength isn’t personal</b> <br><br> 
                                It’s really important that you don’t use anything 
                                personal to you, like a nickname, your date of birth or your pet’s name. This is 
                                information that’s really easy for a hacker to find out simply by looking at your 
                                social media, finding your online work profile or even just by listening in on a 
                                conversation you’re having with someone else.
                            </p>
                        </td>

                            <p> <b>Avoid past passwords</b> <br><br>
                                It’s also really important to make sure you don’t recycle your passwords, 
                                particularly if they’ve been hacked before. This may seem obvious, but once 
                                you’ve used a password, you shouldn’t reuse it. Even if you haven’t used it 
                                for years, it’s best to come up with a new one. Especially if you’ve had issues 
                                with a password being hacked in the past.
