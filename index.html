          Project title: A study of password guidelines, user habits and how to support users attain better passwords (EMS6591)
          Researcher name(s): Cristian Popescu
                
          What is the research about?
          We invite you to participate in a research project about the assistance users get when creating their passwords on
          websites. To support the researcher, Cristian Popescu, the survey collects information about the usability of the
          prototype, as well as some facts regarding user behaviors in terms of password security. The survey responses will 
          be crucial as it will allow the investigator to verify how effective the website is in guiding users to attain strong 
          passwords. 

          Do I have to take part?
          This form has been written to help you decide if you would like to take part. It is up to you and you alone whether 
          you wish to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be free to withdraw at any time without providing a 
          reason and without penalty. 

          What will I be required to do?
          You will be asked to test the prototype first, which involves reading some information about passwords, create a 
          password and get feedback regarding the newly generated password. The second part requires you to follow a link that 
          can be found at the bottom of the last page. This link takes you to the online survey where you will be asked to 
          provide essential feedback on the prototype and password habits. No identifying information will be collected, and you 
          can choose not to answer any question. In terms of duration, it should not take more than 10 minutes.  

          How will you handle my data?
          Your data will be stored in an anonymised form and will only be accessible to Cristian Popescu and Jacques Ophoff (see 
          contact details below). This means that nobody including the researchers could reasonably identify you within the data. 
          Your data will be stored on a secure university server, with data fully anonymised at the earliest opportunity (i.e., 
          when data that could identify you is no longer necessary for the purposes of the research). Your responses are treated 
          in the strictest confidence - it will be impossible to identify individuals within a dataset when any of the research 
          is disseminated (e.g., in publications/presentations). Abertay University acts as Data Controller 
          (DataProtectionOfficer@abertay.ac.uk).

          Retention of research data
          Researchers are obliged to retain research data for up to 10 years' post-publication, however your anonymised research 
          data may be retained indefinitely (e.g., so that researchers engage in open practice and other researchers can access 
          their data to confirm the conclusions of published work). Consistent with our data retention policy, researchers retain 
          consent forms for as long as we continue to hold information about a data subject and for 10 years for published research
          (including Research Degree thesis). 

          You can find our procedure for complaints (regarding research projects) and our privacy notice and legal basis for

          Consent statement:
          Abertay University attaches high priority to the ethical conduct of research. Please consider the following before 
          indicating your consent on this form. Indicating your consent confirms that you are willing to participate in the research,
          however, indicating consent does not commit you to anything you do not wish to do, and you are free to withdraw your 
          participation at any time. You are indicating consent under the following assumptions: 
          •	I understand the contents of the participant information sheet and consent form. 
          •	I have been given the opportunity to ask questions about the research and have had them answered satisfactorily. 
          •	I understand that my participation is entirely voluntary and that I can withdraw from the research (parts of the project 
          or the entire project) at any time without penalty and without having to provide an explanation. 
          •	I understand who has access to my data and how it will be handled at all stages of the research project. 
          
          I consent to take part in this study conducted by Cristian Popescu who intends to use my data for further research examining 
          the usability and effectiveness of the prototype to support users in creating strong passwords.
